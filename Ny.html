                <p> I have several hobbies that I do every day. One of my hobbies is cooking with other students. Right now I am working on a project to help other students socialize with others on this idea. Other hobbies I have are:

                <ul>
                    <li> Computer games</li>
                    <li> Design</li>
                    <li> Sketching</li>
                    <li> Sleeping</li>
                    <li> Working out</li>
                </ul>
                <p> I train with a friend. He is strong and helps me focus to push to go down and down the machine. Making me see workout as a teamwork</p>

                <p>I haven't read enough but it helps me with ideas and mentally. Something I enjoyed reading was a design book about design processes. In the book, I learned that practical things need to be built into the design and not thrown in at the end, such as "green". A dsigner needs to see their thoughts from time to time, therefore often go back to where they started to get a little re-inspiration.
